   <h1><span class="line">Hello!</span> My name is <span class="signature">Torfinn.</span></h1>

          <p>
            First, thank you so much for given of your time visiting my website, Torf’s Gallery of Art, showing my own paintings only! Some of which are painted with acrylic, while the vast majority are oil paintings on canvas.
          </p>
   <p>
       Since I retired late in 2018, then my pension is what pays the bills and that provides sufficient financial freedom, while painting has become my passion and pleasure, and what I mainly do on daily basis, but no stress to produce ever. So, the purpose of this website is not to post paintings for sale, as none of them are for sale in the first place, but rather a site which acts as a showcase for my work. My online Gallery of Art is the only place where my paintings are shown and can be seen.
    </p>
   <p>
       My preferred style is figurative maritime motifs, then other motifs with water as an important component, but I also try along testing with shape and color. Some of which are painted with acrylic, while the vast majority are oil paintings on canvas. My paintings are probably far more influenced by my background and whatever I feel for and get inspired to paint, than what is currently considered as correct styles of painting. I did work 20 years at sea and otherwise then I am a dedicated sports fisherman (both at sea and up in the mountains), fond of the wilderness you can say, and such motives transferred to the canvas.
   </p>
    
        <p>
            Always a mixture of fantasy and reality.<span id="dots">.</span>
        </p>

    <p>
        I do not claim to be a professionally educated painter, something I am certainly not, but I have at least participated in a few painting courses led by skilled artists. Nor can it be said that I sticks to any of the styles taught on those courses I have participated in, but what I have learned and got of useful tips that I bring on further, unless otherwise always taken into consideration.
    </p>
   <p>
       Again, thank you so much for visiting and watching. Have a nice day
    </p>
